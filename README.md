# School-Project
A repo for the python programs my school gave as homework. I really do not think this will be of any use to anyone.


1. Write a program to take input of two lists from user and perform the following operations:
(i)Display the list having maximum number of elements.
(ii)Display union of two lists.
(iii)Display intersection of two lists.

Example:
Enter First List:[2,3,4,5,6,7]
Enter Second List:[4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
Output:
[4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
Union:[2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
Intersection:[4,5,6,7]

2. Write a program to take input of a list from user and perform the following operations:
(i)Display the second maximum number from the list.
(ii)Display duplicate numbers from the list.
(iii)Display the highest frequency number with its frequency from the list.
Example:
Enter a List:[2,3,4,5,6,7,3,4,7,4]
Output:
Second Maximum number: 6
Duplicate Numbers: [3,4,7]
4 having highest frequency which is 3.

3. Write a program to take input of a list from user and perform the following operations:
(i)Display the list in reverse order.
(ii)Display each number along with its frequency.
(iii)Display the updated list after swapping first half with second half. For odd number
of elements, the position of the middle element remains unchanged.
Example:
Enter a List: [5,9,7,6,5,10,4]
Output:
Reverse List: [4,10,8,6,7,9,5]
Number
Frequency
5
2
9
1
7
1
6
1
10

4
1
Updated List: [5,10,4,6,5,9,7]

4. Write a Python program to remove duplicate words from a given string and display the
resultant string in ascending order.
Original String:
Next Time There Won't Be A Next Time
Output:
A Be There Won't
____________________________________________________________________________________________
5. Write a Python program to display the frequency of each letter of an input string using
dictionary. Also display the number of vowels and consonants present in the given string.
Original String:
Alligator
Output:
A – 2
G - 1
I – 1
L – 2
O - 1
R – 1
T – 1

6. Write a program to take input of two dictionaries from user and perform the following
operations:
(i)Display add of two dictionaries.
(ii)Display difference of two dictionaries.
Example:
Enter First dictionary: dict1 = {'a': 10, 'b': 5, 'c': 3}
Enter Second Dictionary: dict2 = {'d': 6, 'c': 3, 'b': 8}
Output:
Addition: {'a': 10, 'b': 13, 'c': 6,’d’: 6}
Subtraction: {‘a’:10,‘ b': 3, 'c': 0,’d’:6}

7. Write a program to accept a sentence and perform the following tasks:
(a) Arrange the words contained in the sentence according to the size of the words in ascending
order. If two words are of the same length then the first occurring comes first.
(b) Count number of words starting with vowel.
Example:
INPUT: A STITCH IN TIME SAVES NINE
OUTPUT:
AFTER ARRANGING: A IN TIME NINE SAVES STITCH
NO OF WORDS: 02
____________________________________________________________________________________________
8. Write a program to input a sentence from user and perform the following operation:
(i)Count the number of palindrome words.
(ii)Display the longest word/s of the sentence.
Example:
Sample Input: I love my mom and dad.
Sample Output:
Count of Palindrome words: 2
Longest word: love

9. Write a program to accept a sentence and perform the following tasks:
(a) Arrange the words contained in the sentence according to the size of
the words in ascending order. If two words are of the same length then the
first occurring comes first.
(b) Count number of words starting with vowel.
Example:
INPUT: A STITCH IN TIME SAVES NINE
OUTPUT:
AFTER ARRANGING: A IN TIME NINE SAVES STITCH
NO OF WORDS: 02

10. Write a program to input a sentence from user and perform the following
operation:
(i) Count the number of palindrome words.
(ii) Display the longest word/s of the sentence.
Example:
Sample Input: I love my mom and dad.
Sample Output:
Count of Palindrome words: 2
Longest word: love
